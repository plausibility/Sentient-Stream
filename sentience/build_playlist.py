"""
The idea here is that:
+ This will recurse the "genre dir", finding all genres (folders), and picking a random one.
+ It will then find all music files in that genre, and return a random selection.
+ The script will generate a "playlist" file with the songs in it.
+ It will pop the first out of this list, and print that.
+ When the playlist is empty, it will generate a new playlist, and print the jingle file.
+ This means if the song count is 10, it will play ten songs, then a jingle, followed by ten new songs.
